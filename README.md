# Django Invoice Data Extraction Web App

This Django web application allows users to upload invoices, which are then processed using a YOLO model and Tesseract OCR. The app extracts annotated images and text data from the invoices, allowing users to search for specific information (e.g., by `supplier_ntn_value`) and view all extracted data stored in the database.

## Features
- **Invoice Upload**: Users can upload invoices in image format (e.g., PNG, JPG).
- **YOLO Model for Annotation**: The application uses the YOLO model to detect and annotate relevant parts of the invoice.
- **OCR Text Extraction**: Tesseract OCR is used to extract text from the invoice.
- **Database Storage**: All extracted data is stored in the database.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search the extracted data by `supplier_ntn_value`.
- **View Data**: Display all stored invoice data from the database.

## Requirements
- Python 
- Django 
- Ultralytics (for YOLO model)
