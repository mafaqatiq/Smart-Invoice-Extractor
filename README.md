# Smart-Invoice-Extraction-System

## Django Invoice Data Extraction Web App

This Django web application allows users to upload invoices, which are then processed using a YOLO model and Tesseract OCR. The app extracts annotated images and text data from the invoices, allowing users to search for specific information (e.g., by `supplier_ntn_value`) and view all extracted data stored in the database.

## Features

‚úÖ **Invoice Upload**: Users can upload invoices in image format (e.g., PNG, JPG).  
‚úÖ **YOLO Model for Annotation**: The application uses the YOLO model to detect and annotate relevant parts of the invoice.  
‚úÖ **OCR Text Extraction**: Tesseract OCR is used to extract text from the invoice.  
‚úÖ **Database Storage**: All extracted data is stored in a database for easy retrieval.  
‚úÖ **Search Functionality**: Users can search the extracted data by `supplier_ntn_value`.  
‚úÖ **View Data**: Displays all stored invoice data in an organized format.

## Usage
1. **Upload an Invoice**: Navigate to the upload page and select an invoice image.
2. **Processing**: The YOLO model detects relevant sections, and Tesseract OCR extracts text.
3. **Search Extracted Data**: Use the search function to find specific data (e.g., `supplier_ntn_value`).
4. **View All Data**: Browse all stored invoice data from the database.
